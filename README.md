# Module-4-Quiz
Javascript Quiz #
## Description
This applicaton is designed to help you with some basics of JavaScript. I had to redo this assignment to meet grading standards. Going back doing the Module 4 homework at the end of the bootcamp made me relize how far I have come. I decided to redo the entire app with loops, and that made the code so much cleaner and easier to read. 
## Installation
N/A

## Usage
Quiz for JavaScript, the project is not yet finished, there are a couple bugs I am sorting through, for starters you have to click 'next' then 'previous' to start at the begining of the Quiz.
